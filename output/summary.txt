**1. Main Topic/Theme:** The story centers on the theme of selfless love and sacrifice, specifically within the context of the Christmas holiday and the limitations imposed by poverty.

**2. Key Supporting Points/Arguments:**

* **Extreme Poverty:** Della and Jim are extremely poor, living in a cramped apartment and struggling to make ends meet.  Their limited income severely restricts their ability to buy Christmas gifts.
* **Selfless Sacrifice:**  Both Della and Jim make significant sacrifices for each other, selling their most prized possessions—Della's beautiful long hair and Jim's heirloom gold watch—to buy each other gifts.
* **Irony of the Situation:** The irony is that their sacrifices render their gifts unusable.  Della buys Jim a platinum chain for his watch, which he has sold to buy her the combs she desired.  Their thoughtful gestures are undermined by their simultaneous, unknowingly matching acts of selflessness.
* **The True Meaning of Christmas:** The story implicitly argues that the true spirit of Christmas lies not in the material value of gifts, but in the love and sacrifice behind them.  The title itself, "The Gift of the Magi," connects their actions to the biblical Wise Men, suggesting that their selfless acts are of equal, or perhaps even greater, value.

**3. Overall Conclusion/Message:** The story concludes that Della and Jim, despite their poverty and the unfortunate outcome of their gift-giving, are the "wisest" because their love and sacrifice transcend material possessions.  Their actions highlight the immense value of selfless love and the true meaning of giving during the Christmas season.  The ultimate "gift" is their profound love and devotion to each other, proving more valuable than any material gift.
