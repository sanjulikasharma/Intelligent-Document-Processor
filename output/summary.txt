**1. Main Topic/Theme:** The story explores the themes of love, sacrifice, and the true meaning of Christmas.  It centers on a young couple, Della and Jim, who demonstrate their deep love for each other through selfless acts of giving.

**2. Key Supporting Points/Arguments:**

* **Poverty and Sacrifice:** Della and Jim are impoverished, living in a small, poorly furnished flat.  Their limited financial resources highlight the magnitude of their sacrifices for each other.  Della sells her prized possession, her long, beautiful hair, to buy Jim a platinum fob chain for his heirloom watch. Jim, in turn, sells his cherished watch to buy Della a set of combs she's always wanted.

* **Irony of Their Actions:** The irony is that each sacrifices the very thing the other has purchased as a gift.  Della’s beautiful hair would have perfectly complemented the combs, and Jim’s watch would have showcased the new chain.  This highlights the depth of their love and their misunderstanding of each other's priorities.

* **The True Meaning of Christmas:** The story suggests that the true spirit of Christmas lies not in the material value of gifts, but in the love and sacrifice behind them. Della and Jim’s actions, although seemingly foolish, demonstrate a profound understanding of this principle.  Their gifts, while rendered useless by their simultaneous sacrifices, symbolize the immeasurable value of their love.

**3. Overall Conclusion/Message:** The story concludes that Della and Jim, despite their seemingly unwise actions, are the wisest of all gift-givers because their gifts, though impractical due to their reciprocal sacrifices, are born of genuine love and selflessness.  The story ultimately champions the idea that the spirit of giving, driven by love, surpasses the material value of the gifts themselves. The allusion to the Magi reinforces this, suggesting that the most valuable gifts are those given out of selfless love and understanding.
