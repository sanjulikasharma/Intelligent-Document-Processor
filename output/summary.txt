**1. Main Topic/Theme:** The story centers on the theme of selfless love and sacrifice, particularly within the context of Christmas and the limitations of poverty.  It explores the irony of two lovers making significant sacrifices for each other, only to find their gifts rendered useless by the very sacrifices they made.

**2. Key Supporting Points/Arguments:**

* **Poverty and its impact:** The story highlights the financial struggles of Della and Jim, emphasizing their limited resources and the difficult choices they face in providing Christmas gifts for each other.  Their $8-a-week apartment symbolizes their precarious financial situation.
* **Selfless sacrifice:** Both Della and Jim make immense sacrifices to buy each other gifts. Della sells her prized possession—her long, beautiful hair—to buy Jim a platinum chain for his watch. Jim, in turn, sells his cherished gold watch to buy Della a set of combs she's always desired.
* **Irony of the situation:** The central irony is that their gifts are rendered essentially useless due to their sacrifices. Della's beautiful hair is gone, making the combs unnecessary, and Jim's watch is sold, making the chain pointless.
* **The true meaning of love:** Despite the irony, the story ultimately argues that the true value lies in the selfless love and sacrifice demonstrated by Della and Jim. Their willingness to give up their most prized possessions for each other transcends the material value of the gifts themselves.

**3. Overall Conclusion/Message:** The story concludes that the greatest gift is not the material object but the love and sacrifice behind it.  While Della and Jim are initially portrayed as "foolish children" for their unwise sacrifices, the final lines elevate them to the status of "magi," suggesting that their selfless love surpasses the wisdom of material gifts.  The story suggests that true love and sacrifice are more valuable than material wealth.  The "wise men" of the biblical story are paralleled with Della and Jim, implying that their love is the ultimate gift, exceeding any material offering.
