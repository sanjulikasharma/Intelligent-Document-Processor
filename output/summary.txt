**1. Main Topic/Theme:** The story explores the theme of selfless love and sacrifice, particularly within the context of poverty and the Christmas holiday.  It highlights the irony of two lovers making significant sacrifices for each other, ultimately rendering those sacrifices pointless due to a lack of communication.

**2. Key Supporting Points/Arguments:**

* **Extreme Poverty:** Della and Jim are incredibly poor, living in a cramped, poorly furnished apartment and struggling to make ends meet.  This financial constraint is a central element driving their actions.
* **Selfless Sacrifice:** Both Della and Jim sell their most prized possessions – Della her long, beautiful hair, and Jim his grandfather's gold watch – to buy each other Christmas gifts.  This demonstrates their profound love and willingness to make extreme sacrifices for the other.
* **Irony of the Situation:**  The irony is that both characters sacrifice the very thing the other had planned to buy them. Della sells her hair to buy Jim a chain for his watch, while Jim sells his watch to buy Della combs for her hair.  This creates a poignant and humorous situation.
* **The Value of Love Over Material Possessions:** The story ultimately argues that the true value lies not in material wealth but in the selfless love and sacrifice between Della and Jim. Their actions, though ultimately impractical, highlight the depth of their feelings for each other.

**3. Overall Conclusion/Message:**  The story concludes that the greatest gift is not a material possession but the selflessness and love shown in the act of giving.  Della and Jim, despite their poverty and their unwise choices, are ultimately presented as the "wisest" because their actions demonstrate the true spirit of Christmas and the power of love.  The irony serves to emphasize the importance of communication and understanding in relationships, suggesting that their actions would have been more meaningful if they had communicated their intentions beforehand.
