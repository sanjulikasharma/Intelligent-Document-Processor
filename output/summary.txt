* **Irony of the Situation:** The irony is central to the story's impact.  Their gifts, bought with great sacrifice, are rendered useless due to the other person's sacrifice. This highlights the depth of their love and commitment despite their poor planning.
* **The Magi as a Metaphor:** The story uses the biblical Magi as a metaphor to elevate the significance of Della and Jim's actions.  Though foolish in their approach, their selfless love makes them "wise" in a deeper, more meaningful way than the materially rich.

Della and Jim's seemingly foolish actions ultimately reveal the profound depth of their love and their wisdom in prioritizing their affection over material possessions.
