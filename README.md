# Intelligent Document Processor 

The Streamlit application allows users to upload or select a PDF document, extract text using Google Gemini's OCR capabilities, summarize its content, and ask questions about it using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

## How to run the application?

### Step 1: Clone the Repository 
Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

    ``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/sanjulikasharma/Intelligent-Document-Processor.git
    ```
### Step 2: Install Dependencies using `requirements.txt`
    ``` bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
### Step 3: Running the Application 
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt (if you're not already there) and run the Streamlit application: 
    ``` bash
    streamlit run web_app.py
    ```
This will start the Streamlit server, and your application will open in your default web browser.

**After entering the Google Gemini API key, you can upload your pdf or use the default 'The Gift of Magi' pdf to generate a summary & ask questions related to the pdf.'**
